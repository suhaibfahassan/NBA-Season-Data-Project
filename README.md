# NBA Players Target Project

## This repo will consist of **data cleansing**, **data transformation**, and **gathering insights** through **Microsoft SQL Server**.

### ➡️ The goal of this project is to create a strong integral database of NBA players in the 2023-24 season. This database includes data regarding their performance and salaries.
### ➡️ The purpose of this project is to find a solid roster of players who are trade-eligible/nearing free agency to be picked up by any NBA team. Using this data to be loaded into Power BI, I created a dashboard for NBA teams to give them a better view of the players available to target along with their performances and salaries.
### ➡️ I will include all 30 teams in the NBA and their overall performances throughout the season to compare their strengths and weaknesses in the league.
